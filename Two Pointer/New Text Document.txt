The two pointer technique is used to make algorithms that take O(n^2) time complexity use up O(n).

The two pointers can be used in same direction to:
  - scan data
  - fast and slow pointers to find middle element in a linked list
  - fast and slow pointers to find cycles in a linked list

The two pointers can be used in opposite direction to:
  - find two numbers in a sorted array that sum up to target
  - tell if a number or a string is palindrome or not
